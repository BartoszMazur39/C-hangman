# C-hangman
Solution to the Motorola Academy Codecool coding challenge (C# hangman game)

The game is simple, you will get a random capital city to guess. 
First, you have to choose if you want to guess a letter or the whole word. 
If you guess the letter incorrectly, you will lose 1 life point and the letter will be added to the list of letters that aren't in the word. 
If you guess the word incorrectly, you will lose 2 life points, but if you guess it correctly you will save some time. 
If you guess the final letter or the whole word - you win.

I am coding because i really like it and this is one of my dream jobs.
